# paul-bookmarks-app

Simple bookmarking app.

Completed user stories include: 

- User can add bookmarks to my bookmark list.
- Bookmarks contain: - title - url link - description - rating (1-5)
- I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.
- All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.
- I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.
- Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.
- I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.
- I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.
- Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required).
- I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
- Extension Feature - I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list.
  
  Also:
  
  - User can input url in any format - ie. www.google.com or google.com and it will convert to https://www.google.com
  - Bookmarks with long titles are cut short and affixed with '...' to prevent layout problems.
